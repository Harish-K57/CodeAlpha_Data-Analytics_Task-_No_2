## 🔍 EDA Workflow

### ✔ Asking Meaningful Questions
- What are the important variables in the dataset?
- How are numerical and categorical features distributed?
- Are there relationships between key variables?
- Are there any outliers or anomalies in the data?

---

### ✔ Understanding Data Structure
- Checked dataset dimensions (rows and columns)
- Analyzed data types of each variable
- Identified numerical and categorical features
- Verified missing values and duplicate records

---

### ✔ Identifying Trends, Patterns & Anomalies
- Analyzed data distributions using histograms
- Detected outliers using boxplots
- Explored relationships using scatter plots
- Used correlation analysis to identify variable relationships

---

### ✔ Hypothesis Testing & Assumption Validation
- Used statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Validated assumptions through visual comparison
- Verified correlations using heatmaps and trend plots

---

### ✔ Detecting Data Issues
- Identified missing or inconsistent values
- Observed skewed distributions
- Detected extreme outliers
- Highlighted features requiring transformation or scaling

---

## 📈 Visualizations Used
- Histograms
- Boxplots
- Count plots
- Scatter plots
- Correlation heatmaps

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Developed a structured EDA approach
- Improved ability to extract insights from raw data
- Strengthened understanding of data behavior before modeling
- Gained hands-on experience with Python EDA libraries
